**Centralized data repository** for my custom-made **idle hack’n’slash** 
This repo contains all game content in JSON format, served for both the **client and server**.

---

## Repository Structure


These files are served statically via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so I can deploy updates instantly without needing to rebuild the game or republish to app stores.

## Updating the Data

Every modification is committed via Git and pushed to GitHub.  
Netlify detects the update and automatically redeploys the content.

I use a small personnal game editor to make commits fast and simple.

---

## Goal

Build a **lightweight, fast, and flexible** system to push game content updates without breaking client/server compatibility.

## Author's Note

This is a personal side-project – but I still like keeping things neat.  
Maybe someone will stumble upon this and get inspired – and if you do, hi!
